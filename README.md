## 💡 What is this?
FreelanceFast is a free, secure tool that helps freelancers write persuasive cover letters in seconds. It uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze job descriptions and your skills, crafting the perfect proposal to get you hired.

## 🔒 Security First (BYOK)
We use a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model.
- Your API Key is **NEVER** stored on our servers.
- It is used only within your browser session memory.
- The code is 100% open source. You can audit it yourself.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Get a **Free Google Gemini API Key** [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Go to the [Live App](https://freelance-fast.streamlit.app).
3. Paste your key in the sidebar.
4. Paste the **Job Description** and your **Skills**.
5. Click **Generate** and copy your winning proposal!
